# wikiContributions

wikiContributions is a tool to help scientists get recognition for their contributions to scientific wikis. We believe that eventually, scientific wikis will replace the conventional scientific articles published in expensive and non-collaborative magazines. When this will happen, it will be harder for a member of the scientific community to mention what articles he/she has contributed to in his/her resume, since wiki contributions are collaborative and can be anything from a comma to a whole article. We aim to provide a measurement tool for this, and our project is well under way. You can find information about both using wikiContributions and contributing to the project in the wiki help page : https://github.com/nikixiaoyou/wikiContributions/wiki. 
The code is divided in 2 folders: one which is using code provided from Google-Diff, Match and Patch for revision comparisons (found in the `google-diff` folder) and another which is using WEHA to do such comparisons (found in the `weha` folder).

**If you wish to edit parts of this code, we will gladly add you as a contributor. All you need to do is write a comment in the issue you are interested in!**
