# wikiContributions

wikiContributions is a tool to help scientists get recognition for their contributions to scientific wikis. We believe that eventually, scientific wikis will replace the conventional scientific articles published in expensive and non-collaborative magazines. When this will happen, it will be harder for a member of the scientific community to mention what articles he/she has contributed to in his/her resume, since wiki contributions are collaborative and can be anything from a comma to a whole article. We aim to provide a measurement tool for this, and our project is well under way. You can find information about both using wikiContributions and contributing to the project in the wiki help page : https://github.com/nikixiaoyou/wikiContributions/wiki. 
Code provided for revision comparisons comes from [WEHA] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/weha) and can be found in the `source` folder.
